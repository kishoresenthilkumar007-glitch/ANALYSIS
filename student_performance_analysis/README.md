Student Performance Analysis

This small Python project demonstrates loading student test data, performing exploratory data analysis, training a simple model to predict pass/fail, and producing basic visualizations.

Quick start

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the analysis:

```powershell
python analysis.py data/sample_students.csv
```

Files

- `analysis.py`: main analysis script
- `data/sample_students.csv`: sample dataset
- `requirements.txt`: python package list

You can replace the sample CSV with your own dataset (same columns) and re-run the script.
